                       void?]{Starts a SCGI server on the given hostname and port.

                                    As @racket[scgi-serve] handles each new connection in its own thread it is safe for the handler to loop

                                    (e.g. this can be useful for setting a cookie or JWT).  Its second return value is the state value that will
                                    be passed as the second parameter to @racket[handler].

                                    If @racket[on-connect] is @racket[#f] then the second parameter to @racket[handler] will be the initial

@section{Request and Response}

The @racket{net/scgi} module uses @racket{scgi-request} and @racket{scgi-response} structs to encapsulate an SCGI request and a
standard HTTP response, respectively.  This is similar to the Racket webserver.  

@defstruct*[scgi-request ([method string?]
                         [scheme (or/c "HTTP" "HTTPS")]
                         [host string?]

                         [cookies (promise/c (listof (cons/c bytes? bytes?)))]
                         [post-data (promise/c (or/c (listof (pair/c symbol? string?))

                                                                   Cookies is a promise that when forced will extract cookie headers and

                                                                   Post data is a promise that when forced will extract values from a POST

                                                                   For multipart/form-data this will be an association list where the keys

@section{Websockets}

If you are using nginx as your webserver, it leaves the SCGI sockets open, so it is possible to implement websockets.  To do so, use @racket[make-websock-responder] to create an appropriate responder.

@defstruct*[scgi-ws-conn ([connected? any/c]) #:omit-constructor]{An opaque struct used to handle a websocket connection.  Communicate using @racket[scgi-websocket-send!] and @racket[scgi-websocket-read!].

The synchronization result is the @racket[scgi-ws-conn] itself.  Any control frames received will be handled when the connection is considered for synchronization.}
